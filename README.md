# National Secure Ideas Submission

Implementation repository for the **Secure Innovation Gateway (SIG)** / **American Innovation Shield** described in the *National Secure Ideas Submission Act of 2025* legislative package.

This is a downstream application of the generic [Secure Intake & Case Workflow Engine](https://github.com/neophilism/Secure-Intake-Case-Workflow-Engine). Application-specific policy lives here; reusable case-management behavior stays upstream.

## Current milestone

**PR 5 — parallel agency referrals and accountability**

PR 5 replaces the earlier single-agency case-wide referral path with the
engine's reusable rc.6 referral ledger.

A SIG case may now contain multiple participating-agency referrals in parallel.
Each referral records its own recipient, acknowledgment, response history,
status, and accountability clocks. Routine referrals receive independent
30-calendar-day preliminary-response and 90-calendar-day final-status clocks.
Urgent referrals receive independent 72-hour preliminary-response and
90-calendar-day final-status clocks.

An agreed extension is recorded against the specific referral deadline that was
extended, including the reason and old/new due dates. Missed recipient clocks
escalate through the existing `oversight_compliance` queue without collapsing
the other referrals on the case into the same clock.

The parent SIG workflow now uses a single **Agency Coordination** state.
Entering that state requires at least one actual referral. The case cannot move
from Agency Coordination to Resolved while any referral remains open.

Referral recipients are operational case data rather than a hard-coded agency
list in the application manifest. This keeps the software usable as participating
agencies and interagency routing arrangements change.

The existing unclassified-intake, protected-identity, participant-portal, and
quarantined-supporting-file boundaries remain unchanged.

## Security boundary

**Do not submit classified information through this application.**

The source package contemplates classified submissions only through approved secure channels with cleared personnel, need-to-know controls, secure facilities, validated cryptographic modules/key management, and other high-assurance controls. The generic engine is not an accredited classified system.

The public form therefore requires an unclassified-information attestation and does not attempt to simulate classified handling.

## Privacy and participant-access boundary

Identifying/contact fields remain in the encrypted `submitter_identity` protected compartment. Ordinary SIG content-processing roles do not receive protected-data permissions.

Identity access requires the separate requester/approver workflow introduced in PR 2.

Participant access is independent of identity reveal:

- a participant credential is not a staff account;
- the tracking/confirmation code alone is not sufficient authentication;
- the access secret is not placed in a URL and is not stored in plaintext;
- participant sessions use a separate HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie;
- fully anonymous users can check bounded case status if they saved the credential, but they cannot read or send messages;
- confidential/open submitters can use secure portal messaging because their `identity_mode` permits follow-up.

This preserves the source's distinction between anonymous status tracking and direct communications.

## Engine contract

Pinned engine:

- version: `1.0.0-rc.6`
- source commit: `6145c3401dcfdd64fa7b8bc1423bf52450aefe98`
- target image: `ghcr.io/neophilism/secure-intake-case-workflow-engine:1.0.0-rc.6`
- manifest schema: `1`

See `engine.lock.json`.

## Local deployment

The engine release image must be published before the default Compose deployment can pull it.

1. Copy the environment template:

   ```bash
   cp deployment/.env.example deployment/.env
   ```

2. Replace the development example values in `deployment/.env`. In particular, generate and protect a stable 32-byte `PROTECTED_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` encoded as 64 hexadecimal characters. Losing or changing that key makes existing protected identity ciphertext unreadable.

3. Keep the participant-session cookie name distinct from the staff-session cookie. The default participant TTL is 8 hours and can be changed with `PARTICIPANT_SESSION_TTL_HOURS`.

4. Keep `DOCUMENT_MAX_BYTES` and `PUBLIC_UPLOAD_TOTAL_MAX_BYTES` at or below the deployment limits you intend to support. The supplied development configuration permits up to 50 MB per supporting file and 50 MB combined attachments per submission, inside the engine's 64 MB multipart transport ceiling.

5. Connect an approved malware scanner or authorized external scan process before treating public uploads as operational evidence. The engine deliberately leaves uploads quarantined until a clean result is recorded.

6. Start PostgreSQL:

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file deployment/.env -f deployment/compose.yaml up -d postgres
   ```

7. Run engine migrations. Upgrading to PR 5 applies the referral-ledger migration as part of the normal migration chain:

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file deployment/.env -f deployment/compose.yaml run --rm engine npm run db:migrate
   ```

8. Bootstrap the SIG organization administrator:

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file deployment/.env -f deployment/compose.yaml run --rm engine npm run auth:bootstrap
   ```

9. Apply the manifest:

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file deployment/.env -f deployment/compose.yaml run --rm engine \
     npm run app:manifest -- \
     --file /application/manifest.json \
     --organization secure-innovation-gateway \
     --actor-email "${BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL}"
   ```

10. Assign at least one person to `sig_intake_privacy_officer` and a different person to `sig_privacy_officer` before operationally accepting confidential identities.

11. Start the web application and worker:

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file deployment/.env -f deployment/compose.yaml up -d engine worker
   ```

The public participant login surface is under the engine's `/participant` path and uses the SIG organization slug plus the saved tracking/confirmation code and participant access secret.

## Development sequence

See [docs/development-plan.md](docs/development-plan.md).

The project follows the intended feedback loop: a real downstream requirement is classified as application policy or reusable infrastructure; reusable primitives are implemented neutrally upstream, released, and then consumed here.
